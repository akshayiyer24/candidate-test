# LifeSite Candidates
This is the candidate test for LifeSite developers.


## Guidelines
* Fork this repository, do your work, and **commit often** with descriptive messages. When finished, submit a pull request.
* You may add any libraries you wish.
* Your code should run on the latest modern browsers.

## Getting Started
1. Install the base npm modules with `npm install`.
2. Install bower dependencies with `bower install`.
3. Start up the server with `node server.js`.
4. View in browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Instructions
* Use NodeJS, Express, Mongo, and Angular to create a CRUD application. It can be anything you want - a list of ToDos, 
list of super heroes (or villains), the choice is yours.
 * Use Mongoose as your hook into Mongo.
 * Display the list **outside** of the Welcome page (you will need to create an angular route).
 * Try to keep your components small and modular; separation of concerns and the DRY principle will score you big bonus
 points.
 
## Extra Credit
If you have experience (or want a challenge), using Angular 2 or React to develop your front-end code is totally 
acceptable!
